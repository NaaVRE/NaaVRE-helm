# NaaVRE UI Tests


## Running Tests

First go to the tests' directory:

```bash
cd tests
```
end-to-end tests:
```bash
npx playwright test
```    

Use environment variables to target a deployment and credentials:
```bash
E2E_BASE_URL="https://<host>/vreapp" \
E2E_JUPYTERHUB_URL="https://<host>/jhub" \
E2E_USERNAME="<username>" \
E2E_PASSWORD="<password>" \
npx playwright test
```

For deployments with custom UI labels/selectors, you can override journey actions:
```bash
E2E_START_LAB_SELECTOR="<css-selector>" \
E2E_NEW_NOTEBOOK_SELECTOR="<css-selector>" \
E2E_CONTAINERIZE_SELECTOR="<css-selector>" \
E2E_CREATE_WORKFLOW_SELECTOR="<css-selector>" \
E2E_RUN_WORKFLOW_SELECTOR="<css-selector>" \
npx playwright test
```
Interactive UI mode:
```bash
npx playwright test --ui
``` 

Test only on Desktop Chrome:
```bash
  npx playwright test --project=chromium
```
Run the tests in a specific file:
```bash
npx playwright test example
```
Run the tests in debug mode:
```bash
  npx playwright test --debug
```

Auto generate tests with Codegen:
```bash
  npx playwright codegen
```


And check out the following files:
  - ./e2e/example.spec.ts - Example end-to-end test
